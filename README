This is a simple tool for onboarding users over ssh.

Simply add an "onboard" user, set their shell to "onboard", and start the
included systemd service. Users can be managed with the builtin "onboardctl"
tool, or directly interacting with the sqlite database "/etc/onboard/onboard.db"

More detailed installation steps:

  1. (sudo) python3 -m pip install .
  2. Add user "onboard" with shell $(which onboard)
  3. systemd enable onboard and systemd start onboard
  4. Allow users to login to the onboard account over ssh

This tool was designed and developed by Christopher Milan for UCLA's AI Safety
club. It is not nearly as fully featured as many other solutions may be, but it
is simple and easy to use.
